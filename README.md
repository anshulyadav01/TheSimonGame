# TheSimonGame
A famous memory testing game we have all played atleast once. The project is solely made of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The game uses jQuery extensively for creating the logic behind the frontend. 

## How to play:
1. Press any key on the keyboard and wait till a particular color shows changes.
2. Remember the color and now click the color the computer rendered.
3. Wait till the computer renders the next pattern (if the pattern you entered is correct).
4. If you miss the pattern the game automatically terminates an you can start the game again by presssing any key on keyboard.
